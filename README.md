# Godot
A Godot repository.

[item.gd](https://github.com/sksourcedata/godot/blob/main/src/resource/item.gd) is a script, which the `equipment_type` property is visible in the inspector iff `type` is `Equipment`. It is tedious but at least it is a way to show or hide properties in the editor depending on others.
